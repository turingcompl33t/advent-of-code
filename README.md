## Advent of Code 2020

Welcome to Advent of Code 2020!

### Initial Setup

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone <URL (SSH or HTTP)> advent-2020
```

That's it!

### Working on a Puzzle

Navigate to the top-level of your local clone:

```
cd /path/to/advent-2020
```

Checkout a new branch to work on:

```
git checkout -b my-branch-name
```

Write your code and move it to the folder associated with the appropriate day. Two puzzles are released each day, so each participant may have up to two submissions in any given folder. To keep things sane, follow a standardized naming scheme in which your solution to the first puzzle for day N is named `NAME_part1.EXTENSION` and similarly your solution to the second puzzle for day N is named `NAME_part2.EXTENSION`, where `NAME` is your first name and `EXTENSION` is the file extension associated with your programming language of choice.

Please only add source files to this repository; don't check-in any build artifacts or input files.

Once you've completed the puzzle for a particular day, merge your branch into `master` so everyone else can see your solution. The easiest way to accomplish this is by creating a pull request on Github in your browser.
